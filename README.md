# Hit-the-Balls
A javascript based game I created for **Js13kGames**. It is developed in vanilla JS.

**Js13kGames** is a JavaScript coding competition for HTML5 Game Developers. The fun part of the compo is the file size limit set to 13 kilobytes.

## Running the game
> Just open the `index.html` game and enjoy the game
